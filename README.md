# Roblox-Username-Webcrawler
Need usernames for a game like how rust took avatars for his bots? You're in luck! This webcrawler can randomly take roblox usernames and log them to a file so you can put them in an array. No need for joining a lobby of NDS and manually writing down the names of everyones as this does that for you.


This webcrawler randomly generates a starting userid and works up from there in threes. If a user is terminated they are skipped. Be careful not to send too many requests from one IP or youll get rate limited, you can change the speed it is working at by adding more workers to speed it up but you can get rate limited which slows it down further.




Really useful for creating life-like bots of players. After all, nothing is more lifelike than the actual characters of players themself :)
